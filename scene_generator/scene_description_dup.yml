# This is a world description file that can be used to select the parameters for the test cases.
# parameters can be turned off -> false or on -> true. Specific distribution ranges and values can also be selected.
# A world is described by a scenario, which is a collection of scenes. Each scenario can be executed in a Carla town, and each town will have several connected regions.
#For example, town5 has 5 regions. 1 -> intersection, 2 -> free way, 3 -> intersection, 4 -> free way, 5 -> downtown
